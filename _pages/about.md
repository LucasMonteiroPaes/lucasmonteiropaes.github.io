I am an Applied Mathematics Ph.D. candidate in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), working with Prof. [Flavio Calmon](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/#). My main research interests are fairness, information theory, and machine learning applications for the social good. Before joining Harvard, I received an M.s. in Computational Mathematics and Modelling from Instituto de Matemática Pura e Aplicada ([IMPA](https://impa.br/en_US/)) in Brazil. You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TfmGCuMJX4KaCJKTUMJA-DwL35Nw5Mnt/view?usp=sharing).
